Parse out the ingredients & what they are, what prep steps if any, amount, unit

Pull out for each step the cooking actions and the ingredients involved.

Make sure to categorize the ingredients as to role in the recipe. main protein? Seasoning / herbs? Veg? Cooking liquid?

Then make transformations to the recipe. Eg., substitute an ingredient, make it vegetarian, etc. Change cuisine palette (instead of Italian, South Asian).

A good test case is to turn Italian meatloaf into South Asian meatloaf.
